## Trance music

I have been a big fan of Trance for more than 15 years. I like to attend Trance festivals and parties to get uplifted with the best melodies and breakdowns.
I occasionally dj and build mixes for my favourite tracks. You can check some of my sets [here](https://soundcloud.com/vivalatrancemusic/sets/viva-la-trance-presents-1).

I co-founded a Trance music community: [Viva La Trance](https://www.facebook.com/vivalatrancemusic).
