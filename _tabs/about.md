Full-stack Data Scientist with 5 years of experience. I have experience and passion for owning end-2-end data science projects in an agile environment, starting from identifying opportunities, to developing and prototyping a solution, all the way to deploying, maintaining, and improving production-ready solutions on cloud-based environments or on-premises, following best MLOps and Data engineering practices.

Currently I work as a Senior Data Scientist at [DAIN Studios](https://dainstudios.com/), and I have a background in Business Intelligence and Software Engineering. 
I hold a Master degree in Software Engineering from Wuhan University in China, and I graduated as a computer science engineer from the National Institut Of Statistics and Applied Economics in Morocco.

Feel free to contact me, I'm happy to help you with your next data project!
